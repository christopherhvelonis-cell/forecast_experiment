# Bias Audit – FSM_grok
## Diversity & Framing
- Sources reviewed: same shock library as FSM_chatgpt; alternative event extraction.
- Risks flagged: event polarity misclassification; regime-change sensitivity.
- Subgroup coverage issues: not applicable.

## Error Tables
- Group 1: Shock clustering years show under-coverage at 90%.
- Group 2: Calm years slightly over-wide.

## Mitigation
- Actions: Schaake/ECC for dependence; EnbPI conformal for coverage; document limits.
- Status: PASS
