# Bias Audit – HSM_grok
## Diversity & Framing
- Sources reviewed: parallel to HSM_chatgpt with alternative embeddings.
- Risks flagged: representation drift between vintages; media-topic distribution bias.

## Error Tables
- Group 1: Under-dispersion on media-trust at h≥10.
- Group 2: Mild negative bias on union membership around structural breaks.

## Mitigation
- Actions: break-aware refits; isotonic reliability correction; PIT monitoring.
